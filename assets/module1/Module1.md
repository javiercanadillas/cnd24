# Module 1 - Getting Started with Python development for Cloud

## Basic Setup

Make sure you've completed the steps in [Basic Setup](./Readme.md) before moving forward with this module.

## Understanding the Cloud Shell Editor

Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) for your Qwiklabs project. Once there, enable the Cloud Shell Editor, you'll be working from there from now on.

**Discussion: A walkthrough Cloud Shell Editor**

## Understanding Python tooling

Python requires some tooling to get startedl. You will briefly see some of the most important tools that you'll need so you can start developing Python apps that will be deployed in the Cloud.

### Creating a basic local project structure
Â 
First, let's create a simple project structure by creating a directory to hold all our stuff:

```bash
touch $HOME/.labenv_custom.bash
echo "export WORKDIR="$HOME/cnd"" >> "$HOME/.labenv_custom.bash"
source $HOME/.labenv_custom.bash
mkdir -p $WORKDIR/myfirstapp/src
```

Inside this folder, let's create a basic structure for our service:

```bash
cd $WORKDIR/myfirstapp
```

**Discussion: project/folder structures and languages**

### Managing Python versions with Pyenv

Install `pyenv` by running:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

and then, setup your bash environment:
```bash
cat << "EOF" >> "$HOME/.labenv_custom.bash"
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
EOF
```

Don't forget to source the new file:
```
. "$HOME/.labenv_custom.bash"
```

Test that pyenv is working:
```bash
pyenv --help
```

We'll be using Python 3.11, that we need to install in our system:
```bash
pyenv install --list | grep '^\s*3\.11.*'
pyenv install 3.11.3
```

This will take a while. Relax and maybe grab a cup of coffee.

Set Python 3.11.3 as our global version:
```bash
pyenv global 3.11.3
pyenv versions
```

Now, test that the proper version is active and everything is working as it should:
```bash
python --version
```

### Virtual Environments

Create a new virtual environment in our project folder:
```bash
cd $WORKDIR
python -m venv .venv
```

Now, activate the environment:
```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

If everything went well, the just activated virtual environment should show up in you command prompt.

### Python Packaging System

For Python packages, you'll be using `pip`. Make sure `pip` is the latest version inside your virtual environment:

```bash
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Discussion: Why does this all matter for Cloud?**

## Creating our first application

Go to the `src` folder that will be holding all our Python code:

```bash
cd $WORKDIR/src
```

You'll be using Flask, so use `pip` to install it so you can test your app locally:
```bash
pip install flask
pip freeze > "$WORKDIR/requirements.txt"
```

Now open a new editor window:
```
cloudshell edit main.py
```

And type or paste the following code:
```python
import os

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    name = os.environ.get("NAME", "World")
    return f"Hello {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)))
```

Now, test locally your application:

```bash
python $WORKDIR/src/main.py
```

Open a new terminal, and request the main page running in port 8080. For this to run in the browser, you'd need to open a Preview in port 8080, so for now you'll use `curl`:
```bash
curl localhost:8080
```

Close the previous application by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

Review your app dependencies so far, these will have to be included in your container image when we package the application:

```bash
bat $WORKDIR/requirements.txt
```

### Rye [Optional]

[Rye](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye) is the new Flask's creator management tool for Python. It mitigates a lot of problems that currently exist with the Python ecosystem. Only for Mac OS X and Linux.

The tool is written in Rust, so to try it out it's necesssary to install it on your environment:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Select `1 (default)` when asked.

Then, install Rye:
```bash
source .bashrc
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
cargo install --git https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye rye
```

Create a new sample project to learn how to manage the Python environment with Rye:
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/code/hello-rye
cd $HOME/code/hello-rye
```

Now, you'll use it to manage Python binary distrubutions, virtual environments, packages and more.

Init Rye in your project folder:
```bash
rye init
```

Then, run `rye sync` as suggested by the `rye init` output you you let Rye do the basic setup for your project:
```bash
rye sync
```

Use it to pin a specific Python version (3.10) to the project:
```bash
rye pin 3.10
rye sync
```

Inspect the `pyproject.toml` file:
```bash
bat pyproject.toml
```

Also, note how the pinned Python version has been registered:
```bash
bat .python-version
```

Install a dependency, like flask and gunicorn:
```bash
rye add flask gunicorn
rye sync
```

Observe how the dependencies have been registered:
```bash
bat requirements.lock
```

Finally, enable the virtual environment and test some main.py Python code inside the `src/` directory
```bash
cp $WORKDIR/src/main.py $HOME/code/hello-rye/src/hello_rye
source .venv/bin/activate
cd $HOME/code/hello-rye/src/hello_rye
python main.py
```

There's much more to Rye, this is just scratching the surface of what seems like a very promising tool.
